# iviuser

A Golang-based user information management service.

## Usage

### Using docker

To run the service using Docker, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Then, build the Docker image by navigating to the project directory and executing the following command:

```shell
docker pull ividernvi/iviuser:latest
```

Once the image is built, you can run the service using:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -e IVIUSER_MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_hostname> -e IVIUSER_MINIO_ENDPOINT=<minio_endpoint> --name iviuser iviuser-app
```

This will start the service and map port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host machine. You can verify that the container is running by using:

```shell
docker ps
```

To stop and remove the container, use:

```shell
docker stop iviuser-container && docker rm iviuser-container
```

### Using docker compose

To run the service using Docker Compose, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the service in detached mode. You can verify that the containers are running by using:

```shell
docker ps
```

To stop the service, use:

```shell
docker-compose down
```
